# Shanghai Carbon Market Dataset

We have a dataset which contains various characteristics of the Shanghai carbon market and associated external factors, based on which we can predict the carbon market trading price trend.

Related studies indicate that carbon price forecasting is influenced not only by external factors such as the energy market and financial market but also by uncertainties like policy changes \cite{RN7} and public sentiment \cite{RN44}. Policy changes include adjustments in carbon emission limits, trading system modifications, and the introduction of new energy policies, all of which directly impact the supply and demand relationship in the carbon market. Therefore, we considered data on

- Energy market indicators

- Macroeconomic variables

- International market spillovers

- Environmental indicators

- Public sentiment

- Policy uncertainty
